# virtual-assistant
a simple virtual assistant

This Python project aims to create a virtual assistant that can interact with users by understanding their voice commands and performing various tasks. The virtual assistant can perform functions such as speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, Wikipedia searches, web browser opening, calculator operations, and more, using different libraries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `datetime` library
- `wikipedia` library
- `webbrowser` library
- `os` library
- `pyttsx3` library
- `speech_recognition` library

## Installation

1. Download and install Python 3.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

```pip install datetime wikipedia webbrowser pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition```

3. Download or copy the project files to your computer.

4. Run the `virtual-assistant.py` file with the Python interpreter:

```python virtual-assistant.py```

## Usage

- When the program is run, the virtual assistant will greet you with "Hello! How can I assist you?".

- You can give various commands to the virtual assistant. Sample commands include:

- "how are you": The virtual assistant will ask how you are doing.
- "what time is it": The virtual assistant will tell you the current time.
- "search the web": The virtual assistant will ask you what to search for and perform a Google search.
- "search on Wikipedia": The virtual assistant will ask you what to search for and look up the relevant topic on Wikipedia.
- "calculator": The virtual assistant will ask you to provide two numbers and then add them together.
- "play music": The virtual assistant will play a song from the music folder.
- "exit" or "quit": The virtual assistant will terminate the program.

- The virtual assistant will try to understand the commands and provide appropriate responses.
